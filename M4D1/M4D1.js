//Create a function to convert a number (passed as a parameter) into a string, basing yourself on this example:

//If the number does not have 3,5, or 7, return the original number.
//⚠️ The factor is an integer which evenly divides a number without leaving a remainder.
//One number can have more than one factor, in that case you should return both names.
